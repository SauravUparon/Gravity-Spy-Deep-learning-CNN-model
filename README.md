# Gravity-Spy-Deep-learning-CNN-model
It is a CNN Deep learning module made to clasify the GW glitches for the Gravity Spy Dataset.
It consist of 22348 train images , 4800 validation image dataset and 4720  test images ...which are concatenated for 4 images belonging to same subclass of a single class glitch and then preprocessed through a pipeline and then loaded with a proper size kernel in the CNN model to get and prediction accuracy of 94%.
